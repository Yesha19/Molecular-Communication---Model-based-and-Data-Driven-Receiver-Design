# Molecular-Communication---Model-based-and-Data-Driven-Receiver-Design
This project is a part of wireless communication course which basically involved reproduction of an existing base article. The article aims at analysing the inter-symbol interference of the channel between a transmitter and the receiver. It explores various threshold based receiver schemes in order to optimise the receiver. The data driven approach is useful in the scenario when no prior information is available about the arriving molecules. Moreover the performance of data driven approach and the normal approach turns out to similar after analysing both. Lastly, as part of innovation LSTM model was developed and compared with existing ANN model which ultimately gave a better accuracy.
