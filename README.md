# Molecular-Communication---Model-based-and-Data-Driven-Receiver-Design
This project is a part of wireless communication course which aims at analysing the channel between a transmitter and the receiver. It explores various threshold based receiver schemes for getting an optimal performance. The data driven approach is useful in this scenario when no prior information is available. Lastly, as part of innovation LSTM model was developed and compared with existing ANN model.
