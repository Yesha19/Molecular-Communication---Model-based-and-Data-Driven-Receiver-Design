# Molecular-Communication---Model-based-and-Data-Driven-Receiver-Design
This project is a part of wireless communication course which aims at analysing the channel between a transmitter and the receiver. It explores various threshold based receiver schemes for getting an optimal performance. The data driven approach is useful is useful in this scenario when we have no prior information about the molecules arriving. Lastly, as part of innovation LSTM model was developed and compared with the existing ANN model.
